/* This program is for parsing various quadcopter data and storing them as internal variables. This is a parent library and 
provides virtual functions for the subclasses to implement. 
	The data that needs to be stored (copied from ardrone_autonomy should be similar or more can be added based on generality). 
		* batteryPercent: The remaining charge of the drone's battery (%)
		* state: The Drone's current state as a string form
		* rotX: Left/right tilt in radians (rotation about the X axis)
		* rotY: Forward/backward tilt in radians (rotation about the Y axis)
		* rotZ: Orientation in radians (rotation about the Z axis)
		* magX, magY, magZ: Magnetometer readings (Unit undecided)
		* pressure: Pressure sensed by Drone's barometer (Unit undecided)
		* temp : Temperature sensed by Drone's sensor(Unit undecided)
		* wind_speed: Estimated wind speed (Unit undecided)
		* wind_angle: Estimated wind angle (Unit undecided)
		* altd: Estimated altitude (m)
		* motor1..4: Motor PWM values (Raw units provided by driver) 
		* vx, vy, vz: Linear velocity (m/s)
		* ax, ay, az: Linear acceleration (g)
		* tm: Timestamp of the data returned by the Drone returned as number of micro-seconds passed since Drone's boot-up.

		The parser needs to convert all the data into NWU format for the user interface and controllers to make sense of it. It should also publish the Imu data in the sensor_msgs/Imu format if it is not already done by the driver. This will be useful to maintain standard format for controllers to use.
		The rpyt commands needs to be given in the form of a quaternion with x,y,z representing roll pitch yaw and w representing thrust. the max and min values for rpy are -Pi to Pi. The max and min values for thrust are set in the parser. This will be later set as parameters or inputs from UI
		Possible States for quadstate which can be used in the UI:
			* 0 -> Unknown
			* 1 -> Init
			* 2 -> Landed
			* 3 -> Flying
			* 4 -> Taking off
//Controller should ensure that the commanded angles are between -pi to pi
